*"[...] the IT industry, software giants and online service providers are on a crusade to get rid of the word USER per se. 'People, not users' (Don Norman). Not only users, but also Computers and Interfaces are disappearing as notion and words. Now days they are referred as Technology and Experience. It is one of the biggest hypocrisis of our times that prevents users from seeing their computers and see themselves as a class, as a force. We are all turned into customers."*, [Oila Lialina interview, Neural Issue 51, p. 34](http://www.exacteditions.com/read/neural/issue-51-46159/36/3).
