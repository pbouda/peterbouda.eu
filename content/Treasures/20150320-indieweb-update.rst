I changed the way I receive `webmentions <http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention>`_ last week, and could finally test it yesterday together with `Pierre <https://microblog.pierre-o.fr/2015/and-now-you-have-one>`_ at the Internet Freedom Lisbon Meetup. It worked :-). I want to stay as static as possible with my website, so I chose to use `webmention.io <https://webmention.io>`_ as service within a static `pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/>`_ site. Maybe I'll have a deeper look into `the Indieweb Example Python Flask App <https://bear.im/bearlog/2015/005/indieweb-example-python-flask-app>`_ to run everything on my server, as I already have another Flask app running there anyway. Good to see the IndieWeb technology growing!
