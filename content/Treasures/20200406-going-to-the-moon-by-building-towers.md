[This article](https://thegradient.pub/a-speech-to-text-practitioners-criticisms-of-industry-and-academia/) was published on Hacker News today, a good overview and
criticism of the current hype around NLP and speech-to-text in general. I like
this comparison:

> Stable production-grade NLP models usually are built upon data which is several orders of magnitude larger or the task at hand should be much more simple. For example - it is safe to assume that a neural network can do NER reliably, but as for answering questions or maintaining dialogue - this is just science fiction now. I like an apt analogy - building AGI with transformers is like going to the Moon by building towers
