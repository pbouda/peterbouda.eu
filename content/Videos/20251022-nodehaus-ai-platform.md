## Own Your AI. Train and Deploy your Finetuned Models.

We at Nodehaus build a platform to create synthetic training data for LLM
training and curation of additional training data while the model is used. The
code is open source, available at:

[https://nodehaus.github.io/](https://nodehaus.github.io/)

AI models used in agents mostly perform repetitive tasks that small models can
perform a lot more economically than larger models. This approach is
[faster, saves money and reduces ecological impact](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents/).
