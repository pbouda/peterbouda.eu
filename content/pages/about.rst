This site is about ideas and projects that see coding as an "`algorithmic literacy of processes`_", essential as learning to read and write. Our world is turning every simple object into electronic devices, code is deeply written into our society and from this point of view learning to understand code is essential to be an informed citizen in the 21st century. I will explore the topic from a philosophical, artistic, economical and technological perspective, you will hear from the great thinkers behind amazing projects and explore real-world examples. Every app, mobile or web, should have a button "Edit source code".

The philosophy of hacking things is now roughly 90 years old, starting in the 20s of the 20th century with amateur radio enthusiasts. The hacking culture around computers emerged in the 70s and was first expressed by `a Homebrew Computer Club newsletter`_:

	"By sharing our experience and exchanging tips we advance the state of the art and make low cost home computing possible for more folks ... Computers are not magic. And it is important for the general public to begin to understand the limits of these machines and that humans are responsible for the programming."

This simple idea brought computers to every household in the end, while computers where thought to be special purpose devices for big institutions and universities before. We all know the story, I guess. But think about what has happened in the 40 years since those words were written: the world we are currently living in is run by computers and networks, but we breed a generation of kids in cages of closed app ecosystems and social networks. What we need right now is a new approach so that we and our kids will be on the right side of the "`program or be programmed`_".
