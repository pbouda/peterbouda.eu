Portugal. Our goal is to document and preserve the linguistic heritage in
Europe. My main project at CIDLeS is `Poio <http://www.poio.eu/>`_, a curation
and software development project dedicated to open source technology for
language diversity. To read more about my work and research at CIDLeS please

Projects
--------

Here is a list of my projects as freelancer and employee, in chronological
order:

Predictive text system Poio
...........................

* **Timeframe: 08/2013 -- now**
* **Roles: Project manager, developer and maintainer**
* **Technologies: Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Postgres, nginx,
  mongrel, NLP, Kanban, test-driven (nose)**
* **Link:** http://www.poio.eu

Poio is a predictive text system for under-resourced languages. We developed
the open source project at the "Centro Interdisciplinar de Documentação
Linguística e Social" to support under-resourced languages. The data is extracted
from different online and private sources and processed via a Python-powered
pipeline to an internal annotation graph pivot format (ISO 24612, Language
resource management -- Linguistic annotation framework). N-gram models are
calculated from that data to support word predictions for user input. The online
demo is powered by a Flask web application. Within the project I work as a
developer and manager, supervising a changing development team that consists
of interns, freelancers and employees. This project was implemented test-driven
from the start (with the help of the Python library nose) and we applied Kanban
approach to organize the development in the team. I gave talk about this project
on events like the Sapo Codebits and the Summer School "Coding for Language
Communities".


Web-based interactive installation Freuden|Tanz
...............................................

* **Timeframe: 09/2014 -- 11/2014 (3 months)**
* **Roles: Developer**
* **Technologies: JavaScript, WebGL, three.js, Leap Motion**
* **Link:** https://vimeo.com/112967710


Web application QuantHistLing
.............................

* **Timeframe: 07/2010 -- 08/2014 (4 years, 2 months)**
* **Roles: Developer and administrator**
* **Technologies: Python, Pylons, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Postgres, Apache, NLP**
* **Link:** http://quanthistling.info/


Web application TypeCraft
.........................

* **Timeframe: 10/2013 -- 08/2014 (11 months)**
* **Roles: Consultant and developer**
* **Technologies: Java, JSP, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Postgres, Kanban**
* **Link:** http://typecraft.org

In a cooperation between the "Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet" in
Trondheim/Norway and the "Centro Interdisciplinar de Documentação
Linguística e Social" I planned, supervised and developed the integration of
file format conversion and automatic part-of-speech and semantic tagging into
the TypeCraft web application. The development involved a custom pipeline
from an existing open source tagger, a Python libary to convert file formats
and heteregenous linguistic data models and an existing Tomcat/JSP solution to
allow users to import and annotate language data on a web interface. We used
a Kanban method to organize the tasks that were implemented and tested in three
different locations. I was responsible for the planning and execution of the
tasks at CIDLeS and managed the communication between linguists and developers
within the cooperation.


Language data management libraries Poio API and GrAF-Python
...........................................................

* **Timeframe: 01/2012 -- 02/2014 (2 years, 2 months)**
* **Roles: Project manager, consultant and developer**
* **Technologies: Python, NLP, test-driven (nose), Kanban**
* **Link:** http://media.cidles.eu/poio/poio-api/


Annotation software Poio GRAID
..............................

* **Timeframe: 01/2011 -- 12/2011 (one year)**
* **Roles: Consultant and developer**
* **Technologies: Python, PyQt, NLP**


App Linguadict for Nokia Meego and Symbian
..........................................

* **Timeframe: 09/2010 -- 02/2011 (6 months)**
* **Role: Developer**
* **Technologies: Qt, C++, Perl**

This project was a cooperation with `Linguatec language technologies
<http://www.linguatec.net>`_ to develop a mobile app from the data of their
Linguadict online dictionary. I developed a customized solution to process,
store and access the dictionary data on low-end mobile devices. I was also
responsible for the development of the UI on the Nokia Maemo, MeeGo and
Symbian S60 platforms.
