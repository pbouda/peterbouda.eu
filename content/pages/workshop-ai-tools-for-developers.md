In this course, you’ll explore how AI tools for software developers, for example GitHub Copilot, can significantly enhance your productivity during the planning and implementation of a project. We’ll delve into the inner workings of Copilot, understanding how it processes code and assists in various development tasks. Unlike mere black boxes, Copilot becomes a valuable co-developer, helping you write code, catch errors, and suggest improvements.

We will have a look how Copilot can help you to write unit tests for existing code and support you in the full code review process, including writing good commit and pull request messages. We will also explore how AI tools can help with code review itself so that humans can focus on the review of architectural decisions and the more detailed code analysis.

Besides software development tools there is a now a growing offer of AI-based tools that help with planning and testing software. We will try the most promising tools in an existing software projects in order to learn how you can improve the productivity in the whole life cycle of a software product.
