I am happy to announce my next public Angular workshop, at the
(http://tugait.pt/2017/)[TUGA IT 2017 conference]. The workshop will take
place on May 18th, and it will be a joint workshop about Angular and Xamarin.
Get ready for a full day of cross-platform development! For those of you that
are planning to build a web application, and specifically those that want to
roll out their app on multiple platforms, this will be a perfect opportunity
to get into two of the major platforms for modern app development! Sign up
for the workshop here, there is still some time left for Early Bird tickets:

> Get up-to-speed with all the new features and improvements in recent Angular
> versions to develop your first web application with the help of this
> superheroic framework!

> The workshop will be "hands on", i.e. we will architect a little (demo? no!)
> real-world Angular application with user registration, login and basic
> interaction with user data. You will learn about all the key concepts of
> Angular to develop and maintain complex web applications and how to publish
> them. The basic application we will develop can act as a cornerstone for your
> own next-generation web idea and will give you a quick start into modern web
> application development.
