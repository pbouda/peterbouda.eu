Next week I am taking of to the `Mozilla Festival`_ in the city of
London. And I just can’t wait, I am really looking forward to it! Here
are a few of the expected highlights:

-  The `Meemoo`_ project will there, i.e. Forrest Oliphant, the guy
   behind the project, will attend. I found Meemoo a while ago while
   looking for live coding environments. Check out `this video`_ and see
   what Meemoo can do. As far as I could find out Forrest will perform
   live together with slub at the party on Saturday, which brings me to
   the second highlight…
-  `slub`_ will perform! I really appreciate the work of `Dave
   Griffiths`_, one of the slub performers. Dave is very active as live
   coder and also in a few artistic project that build just cool things
   all over Europe. Check out his website and especially the stuff about
   the Fluxus environment. I try to use it from time to time and wish I
   had more time to play with it.
-  Last but not least I hope to learn more about Firefox OS. After the
   sudden death of MeeGo and Nokia’s switch to Windows Phone, I feel
   quite excited about Firefox OS getting published next year. I still
   have my N950 developer device around and tried to install the N9 port
   of Firefox OS recently, without success yet. Hope to see it live in
   London.

And I am sure there is a lot of other stuff that I will enjoy. It’s just
one week before Codebits, where I will give `a talk`_ this year about my
views on programming as a basic knowledge. I will definitely learn a lot
during the Mozilla Festival about it, to share it then the week after.
This will be just a great November!
