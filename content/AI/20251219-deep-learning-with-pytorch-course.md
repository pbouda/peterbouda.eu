Really happy to announce that my Deep Learning course with PyTorch is now live at Tech Academy! 🎉

This course is something I care deeply about. We don't just use pre-built models or run through basic tutorials. Instead, we build everything from scratch: CNNs, RNNs, attention mechanisms, and Transformer architectures. The goal is to understand how these systems actually work under the hood.

Over 10 hours of content, we start with PyTorch fundamentals and progressively move through neural network basics to advanced architectures, finally building GPT-style models at a structural level. It's all about developing solid intuition for how modern AI works.

If you want to move beyond just calling APIs and actually understand what's happening inside these models, this might be useful for you.

Check it out, the course is in English with Portuguese subtitles: [https://tech-academy.pt/curso/deep-learning-with-pytorch/](https://tech-academy.pt/curso/deep-learning-with-pytorch/)

Let me know if you have any questions about the content or approach!
