While everyone's focused on making models bigger, this paper makes a compelling case for going smallerâ€”especially for agentic AI systems.

The core insight: Most AI agents don't need vast general knowledge. They perform specialized, repetitive tasks where fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) are not just sufficientâ€”they're superior.

Why this matters for Europe:

âš¡ Energy efficiency at scale â€“ SLMs consume significantly less power than their large counterparts. As AI deployment grows, this shift could dramatically reduce the carbon footprint and operational costs of AI infrastructure across the EU.

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Sovereign technology advantage â€“ Smaller models are far more economical to train and deploy. This lowers barriers for European companies and research institutions to develop and control their own AI technologies, reducing dependence on hyperscale infrastructure and foreign tech giants.

ðŸŽ¯ Task-specific fine-tuning â€“ The paper demonstrates that SLMs fine-tuned for specific workflows can match or exceed the performance of general-purpose LLMs in agentic systems, while being orders of magnitude more cost-effective.

For Europe's AI strategyâ€”balancing innovation, sovereignty, and sustainabilityâ€”this approach could be transformative.
