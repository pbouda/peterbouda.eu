This Thursday, today, I am happy to give a talk about multilingual agents and their performance on European languages
[at the AI Agent World Tour: Lisbon MLOps Meetup](https://luma.com/bszaz8e3). We tested a few LLMs that you can run on
consumer GPUs to find out which work best for agentic use cases. I hope to see you there!

We just released the repository so you can find all code, results and visualizations here:
