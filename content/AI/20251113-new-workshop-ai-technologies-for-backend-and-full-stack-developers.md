Just launched a new workshop: "AI Technologies for Backend and Full-Stack Developers".

Over the past months I noticed how many developers struggle to integrate AI capabilities into their applications. Not because AI is hard, but because the landscape is fragmented. You have frontend frameworks, backend services, APIs, caching strategies, rate limiting, cost management – and then you try to add LLMs on top of everything.

This workshop addresses that. Three full days (or six half days) where we work through practical integration patterns. How do you build conversational interfaces with streaming responses? How do you implement intelligent search without rebuilding your entire stack? What's the right caching strategy for LLM responses?

We'll work with modern frameworks across the stack – Java Spring Boot, Go, React – whatever fits your architecture. And beyond just integrating AI into applications, we'll explore how AI tools can accelerate your development process itself. From AI-assisted coding to automated testing and documentation.

The workshop is available online or in-house, in English or German, and adapted to your team's needs.
