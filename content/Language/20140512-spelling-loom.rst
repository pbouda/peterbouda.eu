An event that I try to to visit every year here in Portugal is
`Codebits <https://codebits.eu/>`__. The core of it is a 48h coding competition,
in which teams develop a new and creative idea during Codebits and present it
on a big stage at the end of the event. The audience and a jury selects
the best projects after the presentation. This year I had the idea to develop
a word game that would teach
`Minderico <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minderico_language>`__ vocabulary to
kids. The user interface was inspired by traditional textile
production in Minde, which is still done on weaving looms. The final game is
about patterns: in language, textile and music. The user literally weaves the
solution to build a pattern that is then transformed into sound. The idea
was quite a success, as Microsoft selected us as GameDev VIPs at the beginning
of the event, and in the end we won the 1st prize of the audience!

What you can seen here is the first version, a prototype, which I want to finish
over the next week and then pulblish as open source.
